MicroMouse is an autonomous robot that can search a
10’ x 10’ maze on the floor and find the fastest path
from the start in one corner of the maze to the center.

This project was developed on the second
generation of MicroMouse hardware(based on LM3S615)
from Tianjin Qicheng Co,Ltd.

## 1. License
This project is released under a GPLv3 license. And We
strongly urge everyone to open up their MicroMouse project
 and enrich the entire MicroMouse community.

## 2. Issue
In this project, there is still a bug that is not well
solved. It is the code part of the detection of the
infrared acquisition signal in the underlying code.

## 3. Award
In November 2017, we won the first
 prize of the 6th Tianjin University College Students
  MicroMouse Competitionin, and won
the first place in the top ten MicroMouse competition
 again in the maze that was changed on site.

 And we got an invitation from the Applied Power
 Electronics Conference (APEC) MicroMouse Contest,
 but due to school funding problems, we finally failed
 to make it.
